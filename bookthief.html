            <p>Set in Germany in the years 1939-1943, The Book Thief tells the story of Liesel. Zusak uses an unlikely narrator for his tale, Death, who speaks to us as a reporter, an observer of events, not as someone who causes death, but as one who gently carries off the souls of those who have passed. 

                Whenever I read a book, I cannot help but read it in two ways: the story itself, and how it's written. They're not quite inseparable, but they definitely support each other. With The Book Thief, Markus Zusak has shown he's a writer of genius, an artist of words, a poet, a literary marvel. 
                
                Zusak took the time and effort to invest the narrative with near perfect words and wonderful sentences and great paragraphs and superb chapters.
                I feel everyone should read this book at least once inter lives.</div>
