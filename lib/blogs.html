    <h2>A Brief History of VCS </h2>
        <p>A version control system (VCS) is a tool that tracks changes to files over time, allowing users to recall specific versions later. Version control systems are essential for collaborative software development, as they allow multiple developers to work on the same codebase simultaneously without overwriting each other's changes.
            The first version control systems were developed in the 1970s and were primarily used by software developers.........</p>

        <h2>Book Review: Kafka on the Shore </h2>

Murakami masterfully delves into themes of destiny, memory, and the subconscious, leaving readers pondering the intricate connections that bind us all.

            <h2>Book Review: The Book Thief </h2>
                <p>Set in Germany in the years 1939-1943, The Book Thief tells the story of Liesel. Zusak uses an unlikely narrator for his tale, Death, who speaks to us as a reporter, an observer of events, not as someone who causes death, but as one who gently carries off the souls of those who have passed. 

                    Whenever I read a book, I cannot help but read it in two ways: the story itself, and how it's written. They're not quite inseparable, but they definitely support each other. With The Book Thief, Markus Zusak has shown he's a writer of genius, an artist of words, a poet, a literary marvel. 
                    
                    Zusak took the time and effort to invest the narrative with near perfect words and wonderful sentences and great paragraphs and superb chapters.
                    I feel everyone should read this book at least once inter lives. </p>
